# 🌸 Seasonal Anime Recommendations - Hackathon Project

## 🧠 Why We Created This Project

We developed this seasonal anime recommendation website because:

- Different seasons evoke different moods and anime experiences
- Many viewers associate specific anime with particular seasons
- We wanted to help users discover anime that match the current season's atmosphere
- Seasonal recommendations can enhance the viewing experience by matching the show's setting with real-world seasons
